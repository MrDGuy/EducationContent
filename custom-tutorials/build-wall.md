# Build Wall: Python

## Step 1
Make a function called build_walls(side) with a parameter called side.
1. Give the agent 64 STONE_BRICKS in slot 1

## Step 2
Teleport the Agent to the player

## Step 3
Move the Agent 1 up and 3 left

## Step 4
Using a for loop inside a for loop build 4 walls that are side length long

## Step 5
The outer for loop should loop 4 times.  
The loop inside should loop side times and the agent should place a block down and move forward.  
At the end of the inside loop have the agent turn left ONLY in the outside loop so the agent only turns left 4 times
